# MaxStartDef

Default scene for 3ds Max with a ready-made palette of colored Legacy materials.

## Quick Start

1. Download the `.bat` file.
2. Run it — it auto-downloads `maxstart.max` and installs it to all 3ds Max versions on your system.

Done.

## Purpose

3ds Max loads this file on startup — so you always start with a clean scene and predefined colored materials for quick part separation.
